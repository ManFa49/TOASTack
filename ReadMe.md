## Installation

To install TOASTack, you can use Swift Package Manager. Add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ManFa49/TOASTack.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ManFa49/TOASTack/releases) section. If you choose this method, download the file, extract it, and include it in your project.

## Usage

Using TOASTack is simple. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to display a toast message:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TOASTack

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Toast") {
            Toast.show("This is a toast message!")
        }
    }
}
```

This code will display a toast message when the button is pressed. You can call `Toast.show()` with a string to show a basic toast.

## Customization

TOASTack allows you to customize your toasts easily. You can change the duration, position, and style. Hereâ€™s an example:

```swift
Toast.show("This is a custom toast!", duration: 2.0, position: .top, style: .success)
```

You can define your own styles by creating a new `ToastStyle`:

```swift
struct CustomToastStyle: ToastStyle {
    var backgroundColor: Color = .blue
    var textColor: Color = .white
    var cornerRadius: CGFloat = 10.0
}
```

Then, use it like this:

```swift
Toast.show("This is a custom styled toast!", style: CustomToastStyle())
```

## Examples

### Basic Toast

```swift
Toast.show("Hello, World!")
```

### Success Toast

```swift
Toast.show("Operation successful!", style: .success)
```

### Error Toast

```swift
Toast.show("An error occurred!", style: .error)
```

### Custom Duration

```swift
Toast.show("This will disappear in 5 seconds.", duration: 5.0)
```

### Custom Position

```swift
Toast.show("I'm at the bottom!", position: .bottom)
```
